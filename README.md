# Tech used: Javascript, React, NodeJS, Express, MongoDB
This website was built using the MERN stack. For the front end, I used React and styled components with Material UI to create a dynamic and responsive user interface. Spoonacular API was used to add the search functionality which allows users to autofill nutrient data and image for food items. A data visualization for calories and amcronutrient intake trend is incorporated using the ChartJS library. The backend is built in NodeJS, using an Express web server and MongoDB database serving a REST API. A secure user registration and authentication is implemented using Bycrpt and JSON Web Tokens.
