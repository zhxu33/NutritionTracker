# How It's Made
Tech used: Javascript, React, NodeJS, Express, MongoDB

My first full stack web application using mern. Built backend is NodeJS using Express web server and MongoDB database. Created a dynamic and responsive user interface using React and styled components with Material UI in the front end. Incorporated data visualizations for calories and macronutrient intake trends using ChartJS library. Used Spoonacular API to add autofill functionality for food nutrient data and images. Implemented secure user registration and authentication  using Bcrypt and JSON Web Tokens.
